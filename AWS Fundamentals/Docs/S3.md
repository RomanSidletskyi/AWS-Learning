## Simple Storage Service (S3)

- Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
- S3 is object-based – allow you to upload files.
- Files can be from 0 bytes to 5TB.
- Files are stored in buckets.

## S3 Buckets

- A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained in a bucket.
- For example, if the object named photos/puppy.jpg is stored in the awsbucket1 bucket in the US West (Oregon) Region, then it is addressable using the URL - https://awsbucket1.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg.

- Buckets serve several purposes:
    - They organize the Amazon S3 namespace at the highest level.
    - They identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer charges.
    - They play a role in access control.
    - They serve as the unit of aggregation for usage reporting.

## S3 Objects

- Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3.
- Think of Objects just as files.
- Object consist of the following:
    - Key – the name of the object
    - Value – the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes
    - Version ID – for versioning
    - Metadata – data about data you are storing

- Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled on buckets, and you must explicitly enable it.

## S3 Keys

- A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key.
- The combination of a bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identify each object.
- So you can think of Amazon S3 as a basic data map between "bucket + key + version" and the object itself.
- Every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version.
- For example, in the URL https://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl, "doc" is the name of the bucket and "2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl" is the key.

## S3 storage classes

- Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class associated with it.
- For example, if you list the objects in an S3 bucket, the console shows the storage class for all the objects in the list.
- Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes for the objects that you store. You choose a class depending on your use case scenario and performance access requirements. 
- All of these storage classes offer high durability.
